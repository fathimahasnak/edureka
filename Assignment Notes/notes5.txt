Steps: Open VS code terminal
1. npm init
2. npm install express body-parser nodemon --save
3. app.js => change script in package.json => "start": "nodemon app.js"
4. Create folders - Routes, Controllers, Models
5. MVC-R Architecture

Example - Ordering food in restaurant
1. Model -
    -> Data, on which we will be performing some task
    -> chef - cooks the food and passes back to the controller
2. Controller - 
    -> Method/Function to perform the task
    -> waiter - who will pass the request of customer to the chef
3. Routes -
    -> path 
    -> customer - requests for menu to the waiter
4. View -
    -> Menu card

Example - shopping cart 
    -> The items are displayed on screen 
    -> User selects an item and clicks on Add to Cart button 
    -> That item is stored under the cart.
        1. 1st Model - items details , 2nd model - output model -> store the selected item
        2. Controller - Method for Add to cart button
        3. Router - access / call the controller for Add to Cart
        4. View - display list of items in cart

6. Solve Q1 and Q2
7. MongoDB -
    > open mongodb.com
    > Install mongodb
    > open shell
    > mongod > mongo
    > install mongoose --save
    > mongodb connection in app.js
    > create model schema in models folder for Mealtype.json
